## What is Dream Scape?

Dream Scape is a revolutionary full-stack web application that allows users to record and keep track of their dreams via entries.

Equipped with a rich-text editor, each entry is personally customizable depending on the individual user. Users can create an entry for each dream encounter they have. Users can also update and delete an entry.

## Technologies Used

Dream Scape is a full-stack web application. Backend technologies include Python, SQLAlchemy, and Flask. Frontend technologies include Javascript, React, and Redux. Chakra UI, an external React Component library, was used to style most of the components in this project. React Quill, a rich-text editor API, was integrated to help make entries more customizable.

## Conclusion and Future Plans

Dream was a fun project that I enjoyed immensely. Driven by a real life event that took place, I was estatic that I was able to bring this idea to fruition. This project challenged my knowledge and limitations as a software developer. Through much stress and frustration, I learned a lot about myself, my abilities as a software developer, and my mental capacity as a life long learner. This project was indeed a journey in itself and I couldn't be more pleased with the results. 

However, there is much more work to do before I can consider this project finished. I plan to implement a "Record" feature where users can store their dreame entries into a Record. Users can also make multiple Records to store different types of dream entries. I also plan to implement a search feature so that Users can search for certain entries they have made and a tagging system to better categorize entries.
